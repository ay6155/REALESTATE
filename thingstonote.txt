1. All your buttons should be the same sizes and lengths
so instead of using padding to size, use actual height and width

2. You still have to work on layout, you're using so many unneccasary tags that makes your styling harder. you're using divs where they're not need, using some tags for another purpose which they were not created. for example, why did you create a "fullpage-container" class when you already have your body tag to do that? then immedietely after your header inside your main tag you still have a "fullpage-box" tag? thats utterly confusing to anyone reading your code. you've got to make research and read about HTML doc layouts and how to structure your websites HTML

3. Noticed that when you apply "display:flex;" you forget that the default "Flex-direction" for display flex is "row", expect stated otherwise, so immediately you apply display-flex, flex direction is row already so you don't need to call "flex direction: row" again, you're just repeating unneccasary code. it is only when you now want to change the flex direction from row to column depending on what you want to do, that is when you can now write "flex-direction:column", also, i noticed that you never "align-items" or "justify-content", almost all through your code, you never apply this properties, i dont know why but i think you should go back and read about display flex so you can understand fully how to use it.
